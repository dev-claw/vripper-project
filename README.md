## Docker Support

This project is fully compatible with **Docker** and can be run as a container.  
The provided Docker image exposes the service and allows you to configure runtime behavior via environment variables.

### Run with `docker run`

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 30000:30000 \
  -e GRPC_ENABLED=true \
  -e GRPC_PASSPHRASE=my-secure-secret \
  ghcr.io/OWNER/IMAGE_NAME:latest
```

### Run with Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: ghcr.io/dev-claw/vripper-web:latest
    environment:
      - GRPC_ENABLED=true
      - GRPC_PASSPHRASE=super-secret-passphrase
    ports:
      - "30000:30000"
```

> **Tip:** For production, prefer storing the passphrase as a secret (see `Security Notes` below) rather than writing it
> directly in the Compose file.

### Environment Variables

The container supports these environment variables for enabling and securing the gRPC server.

### `GRPC_ENABLED`

- **Type:** String (interpreted as Boolean)
- **Accepted values:** `true` (case-insensitive) to enable; any other value or unset â†’ disabled
- **Default:** `false` (gRPC disabled)
- **Behavior:**
    - When `GRPC_ENABLED=true`, the application will attempt to start the gRPC server (default port: `30000`).
    - When absent or set to anything other than `true`, the gRPC server will not be started.
- **Example (shell):**

```bash
export GRPC_ENABLED=true
```

- **Example (Docker Compose):**

```yaml
environment:
  - GRPC_ENABLED=true
```

- **Notes / Best practices:**
    - Treat the value as a simple on/off toggle. To avoid ambiguity, set explicitly to `true` or `false`.
    - If you enable gRPC, make sure any required authentication (see `GRPC_PASSPHRASE`) is also configured.

---

### `GRPC_PASSPHRASE`

- **Type:** String
- **Default:** *no default* (empty / unset)
- **Required if:** `GRPC_ENABLED=true`
- **Purpose:** Shared secret used to authenticate gRPC clients. The application should validate that the passphrase is
  present when gRPC is enabled and use it to verify client connections.
- **Example (shell):**

```bash
export GRPC_PASSPHRASE="my-very-strong-passphrase"
```

## Important Note About Proxies
The use of proxies within VRipper is worthless, please stop using them **for now**. You will get **403 error** codes.  

**403** is a response code coming from Cloudflare to block VRipper from accessing the site, Cloudflare is doing the job it is supposed to do, which is blocking automated requests from accessing the site. 

If your ISP is blocking access to `vipergirls.to` domain, consider using a VPN or [Cloudflare WARP](https://one.one.one.one/) to bypass the block.
